# AI Usage Report — Assignment 1

## Tools Used and How They Were Used

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT was used as a support tool during development. It helped with:
- Improving HTML and CSS structure and readability
- Identifying and removing duplicated or unnecessary code
- Suggesting improvements for responsiveness and accessibility
- Explaining JavaScript logic for features such as theme toggling and scroll-based animations
- Suggesting the use of icon libraries (such as Devicon) to visually represent skills and links

I reviewed and adjusted the suggestions to fit my project and design.


## Benefits of Using AI
- Helped speed up debugging and code cleanup
- Made it easier to understand better practices for organizing CSS and JavaScript
- Provided guidance on selecting and placing icons to improve the visual clarity of the interface
- Offered explanations that improved my understanding of front-end concepts

## Challenges and Limitations
- Some suggestions needed adjustment to match my design and assignment requirements
- I had to carefully review AI-generated code to avoid redundancy and ensure correctness

## Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment and the use of AI tools, I learned:
- How to build a responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- How to implement a dark/light theme using CSS variables and localStorage
- How to enhance a UI using icons without overloading the design
- The importance of reviewing and understanding AI-generated suggestions before using them

## Responsible Use and Modifications
All AI suggestions were reviewed, edited, and tested manually.
I selected which icons to use, adjusted their styling, and integrated them into the design myself.
I also removed unnecessary code, refined layout decisions.
